# simple-grid
I created this project to teach myself how to build a grid system.
A grid is a essential component of a CSS framework. Bootstrap, Foundation have advanced grid system, but i wanted to create my own to understand the internals.
Also, it was a good opportunity to start using SaSS and Gulp.

> This grid system is absolutely basic. You don't want to use it in a real product, at best you can use it for your personal website if you don't need to do more complicated things.
> It's not responsive yet, but this will be implemented shortly
